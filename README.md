GROUP  PROJECT  : AUTOMATIC LAWNMOWER 
 
INTRODUCTION: 
Everything in the world is rapidly converting into automatic from the auto correction of words in mobiles to the gear shifting in the vehicles. In this new revolution the electronic equipment and machines are also being automated with help of microcontrollers and sensors. An Automatic Lawn Mower, as the name suggest, is also a modified lawn mower which works on its own without any supervision. This is automation is achieved by using Arduino and some sensors. This machine works on its own completely saving our time and energy but can also be operated using our mobile.  
 
A lawnmower, referred to as a mower, grass cutter, or lawnmower, is a machine designed to trim grass surfaces uniformly using one or more revolving blades. Traditionally, mowers operated by propelling the blades forward through the motion of the machine itself, with the option of being powered by an electric motor or an internal combustion engine. Over time, various lawnmower designs have emerged.  
 
The mower's cutting height is typically determined by its design but is adjustable by the operator, often through a single master lever or individual levers on each wheel. Smaller mowers rely on manual force, with wheels mechanically connected to the cutting blades, causing them to spin as the mower moves forward. Conversely, larger mowers may feature a battery-powered or plug-in electric motor. The most common power source for lawnmowers is a small internal combustion engine, usually a single cylinder. In recent times, there has been the introduction of robotic lawnmowers capable of autonomous operation or remote control by an operator.  
 
Historically, grass cutting in various settings like schools, sports tracks, fields, industries, hotels, and public centers, was a manual task accomplished with a cutlass. Despite its manual nature, this method offered precision in cutting levels. This project focuses on developing a mechanical lawnmower capable of efficiently cutting various types of vegetation, with a design emphasizing flexibility, mobility, and component interchangeability.  
 
The project aims to achieve objectives such as reducing grass cutting costs, enhancing environmental aesthetics, and minimizing the physical burden on humans. The mechanical lawnmower integrates a blade for even grass cutting without requiring fuel. Furthermore, there are plans to enhance safety and convenience by creating a portable version that can be folded and stored in a compact bag. This innovative design not only facilitates easier storage but also ensures user safety.

PROJECT DEVELOPMENT: 
RESULTS: 
The primary goal of this project is to design an automated lawnmower capable of efficiently mowing the lawn. The subsequent objective is to create a prototype mower that can be controlled through a smartphone while performing lawn maintenance. The final objective involves testing and evaluating the functionality of the innovative product.  Addressing the initial objective is essential, given that lawnmowers are categorized as potentially hazardous products, requiring cautious use and adherence to proper instructions.   Consequently, prioritizing the design of the lawnmower becomes imperative to enhance safety during operation and prevent unnecessary incidents. The innovation, therefore, focuses on a carefully tuned design that enables remote control through a smartphone.  
  
Subsequently, the innovation undergoes testing to assess its operational capabilities, specifically its ability to be controlled via smartphone for lawn mowing. The experiments conducted reveal that the product has successfully achieved 90% of the objectives, demonstrating its operational effectiveness and alignment with the envisioned capabilities.  
In summary, the resulting product is a compact automatic lawnmower that will notify the owner if the mower not working. Its incident reporting functionality extends to smartphone operation through the Blynk app. Significantly, this product is characterized as a green technology solution, utilizing battery power to eliminate pollution concerns associated with traditional petrol-fueled alternatives.  
 
DISCUSSION: 
Based on the results from the experiments, if the obstacle is not too great, this product can be used effectively. As a result, this product is intended for use on urban residential lawns. This is due to the fact that this is a small product. With that, this product is ineffective when applied on a larger field, such as a football field. That type of lawn will take a long time to complete the job. If we want the mower mechanism to work in extreme grass conditions, the motor must be changed with higher torque and speed type of motor. In addition, the blade in the mower mechanism can be changed using a safer material such as cable tie.
